Package: LinearVizPack
Title: Visualization Tools for Linear Models
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Giancarlo","Pantano",email="giancarlopantano@usf.edu",role =  c("aut", "cre"))
Description: What the package does (one paragraph). 
 The package will provide specialized functions in order to create 
 customized, publication ready visualizations. 
 The visualizations will be specific to standard R linear models.
 I will focus on the relationships between predictor 
 variables such as linearity, errors, and variance. 
 Ultimately saving researchers time to prepare and create 
 linear visualizations.
Depends: R(>= 4.5.1)
